1. open git bash
2. use "ls -lr" to check which folder is this
3. for me, I need to use go to the correct folder by:
	cd ..
	cd DFO-MPO/Work/gittest
4. git init
5. git add .
6. git remote -v
7. git remote add origin https://github.com/yi-xu/hello-world
8. git remote -v
9. git pull origin master
** if fails with the error fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
then use:
	 git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories
go to vi mode: write some markers, press Esc, press :(colon), enter q!

10. git pull origin master (again) until it comes out: 
$ git pull origin master
From https://github.com/yi-xu/hello-world
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.

11. ls -lr check files
12. copy the changed stuff to the local master folder
13. git push origin master



To delete master link from a WRONG folder(repository), use: rm -rf .git
