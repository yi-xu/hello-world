1. open git bash
2. use "ls -lr" to check which folder is this
3. for me, I need to use go to the correct folder by:
	cd ..
	cd DFO-MPO/Work/gittest
4. git init
5. git add .
6. git remote -v
7. git remote add origin https://github.com/yi-xu/hello-world
8. git remote -v
9. git pull origin master
** if fails with the error fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
then use:
	 git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories
go to vi mode: write some markers, press Esc, press :(colon), enter q!

10. git pull origin master (again) until it comes out: 
$ git pull origin master
From https://github.com/yi-xu/hello-world
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.

11. ls -lr check files
12. copy the changed stuff to the local master folder
13. git push origin master

%%create new branch locally
git branch localdev
%%delete unused branch locally
git branch -d unused_branch_name
%%check all remote and local branches
git branch -a
%%delete unused branch remotely
git push origin --delete readme-edits #readme-edits was the branch name under origin
%%change branch names locally #need to do it under the branch that need to be changed
git branch -m newbranchname
%%switch to last branch
git checkout -
%%switch branch names
git checkout local_branch_name

%% 

1. git add somefile.txt
2. git commit -m "updateinfo_name"
3. git push origin localmaster


 git push origin localmaster:remotedev



%%To delete master link from a WRONG folder(repository), use: rm -rf .git
 
git commit -m "update_memo_file"
On branch master
Untracked files:
        gitmemo.txt
        tempfolder1/
        xy1.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

need to git add filenames.txt to add all files to the repository
